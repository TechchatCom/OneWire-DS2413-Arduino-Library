# OneWire-DS2413-Arduino-Library

Arduino library to support the Maxim DS2413 2 x PIO switch

The DS2413 is a dual-channel programmable I/O 1-WireÂ® chip. 
The PIO outputs are configured as open-drain and provide up to 20mA continuous sink capability 
and off-state operating voltage up to 28V. Control and sensing of the PIO pins is performed 
with a dedicated device-level command protocol. To provide a high level of fault tolerance in 
the end application, the 1-Wire I/O and PIO pins are all capable of withstanding continuous 
application of voltages up to 28V max. Communication and operation of the DS2413 is performed 
with the single contact Maxim 1-Wire serial interface. 

The OneWire DS2413 Arduino Library provides a class to simplify accessing DS2413 devices. 

Refer to the example DS2413_Basic.ino for usage.
